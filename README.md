A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Description
Feature hashing, also known as the hash trick, is a technique used for feature engineering in machine learning. It is used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional feature spaces by mapping the original features to a smaller feature space.

## Usage 
Can be useful when working with large-scale datasets with a high number of features, especially in text-based datasets. In such datasets, the number of unique features can easily reach millions, which can make it computationally expensive to train machine learning models using traditional techniques.
